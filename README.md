## Authors/Developers: Le Duy An Tran, Le Thien An Tran, Matthew Negasi, Anudari Batsaikhan, Mohammed Mahmood
### About
Furrmily revolutionizes how pet families and owners coordinate pet care responsibilities. The application intends to provide pet owners with a collaborative experience to reduce their workload and ensure the well-being of their beloved pets. It offers all the essential requirements to meet pet owners' needs. Users can create and manage pet profiles, chat, and invite and join pet profiles to access each pet's needs and information. The application encourages communication among pet profile members, allowing real-time updates and discussion through an in-app chat platform and task status updates. The chat feature will enable users to track all pet-related discussions and important pet updates. It also provides an in-app calendar for scheduling pet activities and appointments. Furthermore, any member in a pet profile can assign and re-assign others with newly created pet care tasks. The assignment ensures all members know their responsibilities for the pets' well-being.
### Core Tech Stack

### Roadmap
- In Version 1 (Minimum Viable Product), we will deliver the core components of
the collaborative pet care management system. These components include
account authorization, shareable pet profiles, chat, and task updates and
assignments.
- In Version 2, we will deliver further options for the system’s completeness.
Specifically, these options should focus on optimizing communication between
the profile members. The application should also let the members actively
engage in critical situations.
- By Version 3, we will introduce external systems to Furrmily, expanding its
utilities even more. The application will be ready to adopt and integrate any
potential partnership systems. In Version 3, users should be able to
communicate with any pet-related activities as in real life through the system.
Furrmily strives to become an all-in-one platform as the system grows. Its target
is to provide multiple options for users to strengthen their connection with their
pets.
